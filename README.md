# Huff4Java
Huffman compression and a cross-platform UI

## What is Huffman?
- Huffman is loseless compression and decompression algorithm for compressible files. It works by placing data from a file into a binary search tree, where the most used characters are placed higher on the tree (further from the root). Because most file formats are already compressed, this algorithm will only shorten "raw" files that are compressible. While all files can be compressed with the algorithm, non-compressible files show no decrease in size.
> Huff files are stored, in binary, with the following consecutive data: Number of bytes, Tree data, Traversal Data.

## What technologies/frameworks are involved?
- Java
- JavaFX/[OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/) for cross-platform UI development
- Binary Search Trees, Trees and Tree Traversal 



## What did I learn
- Real-world uses of some data structures. Trees and traversal algoriths have real-world implications
